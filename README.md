**Objectives**
------------
The main objective for this project is to develope a tool to assist physicians
* Given a collection of training data, develop a model that outputs a heatmap showing regions of a biopsy image likely to contain cancer.
* The output might act as an automatic second opinion
* The tool could reduce misdiagnosis at little cost


**Dataset**
------------
The dataset contains slides and tumor masks from the [CAMELYON16](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/) dataset.
